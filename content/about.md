I'm a geography Ph.D. from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and a graduate of the MIMSHAK program for integrating scientists in the public sector in Israel. Currently I'm a post doctarate fellow in the geosimlab in Tel-Aviv university. 
My interests are transportation, urban planning, mapping, GIS, and tweaking with Data.
